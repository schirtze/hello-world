# hello-world
Just another repository

I'm writing this because I am following the github tutorial. I've used the git cli a few times before.
Github seems pretty nice. Now I can start jumping on OS projects and building a public portfolio.

Not sure what I want to do in CS/Programming yet. I think Rust is a really cool language, maybe something with that.
As of writing this I'm reading the book Neuromancer, it's fun seeing how the future was imagined during the early *nix days.
